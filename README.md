- 👋 Hi, I’m @TuskDied
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a software engineer, but I am open to most jobs that work with CS students
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to mess with APIs for personal projects
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project because I am not picky on what to work on (might change in the future)
- 📫 How to reach me p3dvvr@gmail.com
